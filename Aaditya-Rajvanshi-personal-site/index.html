            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
              I’m an Information Systems student at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business with
              a strong interest in how data and technology can drive smarter business decisions. My
              background spans computer science coursework, competitive athletics, and community-focused
              roles, which has shaped how I lead, collaborate, and solve problems.

              <h3>What I do</h3>
              <p>
                I focus on building a foundation in business and technology through my studies in
                Information Systems while applying those skills in real-world settings. As a swim
                instructor and food distribution manager, I’ve managed operations, coordinated teams,
                and communicated clearly with families and community members.
              </p>
              <p>
                On campus, I’m involved with professional organizations like Kappa Theta Pi, where I
                contribute to community, recruiting, and leadership. I’m particularly interested in
                roles that let me use analytics to improve processes and outcomes.
