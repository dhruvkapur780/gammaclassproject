# Pawan Tegala — Personal Website

A simple, professional single-page site. Replace all `[placeholder]` text and links with your own content.

## Quick start

Open `index.html` in a browser, or run a local server:

```bash
# From this folder
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Then visit http://localhost:8000
```

## What to edit

- **index.html** — Update all `[bracketed]` placeholders: tagline, about, experience, projects, contact links, email, and social URLs.
- **styles.css** — Optional: change `:root` variables (colors, fonts, spacing) to match your brand.

No build step required; everything is static HTML, CSS, and a small JS file.
