# Mihika Odak — Personal Website

A one-page professional site with placeholder content. Replace the bracketed text and links with your own.

## Quick start

Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click the file or use **File → Open** in your browser).

For local development with live reload, you can use any static server, for example:

- **VS Code**: Install "Live Server" and right-click `index.html` → "Open with Live Server"
- **Node**: `npx serve .` then visit http://localhost:3000

## What to customize

1. **Hero** — Tagline, short bio, and call-to-action buttons  
2. **About** — Your story and a photo (replace the "Your photo" placeholder box with an `<img>` when ready)  
3. **Experience** — Job titles, companies, dates, and descriptions  
4. **Skills** — List your skills/domains (the list is in `index.html`)  
5. **Projects** — Titles, descriptions, and real links; add images by replacing the placeholder divs  
6. **Contact** — Your email and social links (LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, etc.)  
7. **Meta** — Update the `<title>` in `index.html` if you want a different browser tab title  

All placeholders are written in square brackets like `[Your text here]` so you can search for `[` in your editor to find them quickly.
