            <h2>About Tanya</h2>
            <p>
              A Kelley junior bringing together marketing, technology, and data.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            <p>
              Tanya is a junior at the
              <strong>Indiana University &ndash; Kelley School of Business</strong>
              majoring in <strong>Information Systems, Marketing, &amp; Business
              Analytics</strong>. She&rsquo;s especially interested in how
              data‑driven insights can power smarter marketing decisions and
              more impactful business strategy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Her interest in analytics started on the tennis court. While
              actively competing, she began recording tournament matches and
              breaking down the data to understand which strategies worked and
              which didn&rsquo;t. Later, as the co‑founder of a jewelry
              business, she used data again &mdash; this time to decide what
              products to sell, how to price them, and which marketing channels
              to prioritize.
            </p>
            <p>
              These experiences taught Tanya how powerful data can be when
              paired with creativity and an understanding of people. They also
              sparked her long‑term interest in information systems, business
              analytics, and marketing.
