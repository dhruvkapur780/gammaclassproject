        <div class="about-text">
          <p class="lead">I am a driven and impact-focused student at the Kelley School of Business with a strong interest in finance, consulting, and social entrepreneurship. I combine analytical rigor with clear communication—honed through competitive debate and case competitions—to deliver data-driven solutions.</p>
          <p>I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Business with a major in Finance and a minor in Theatre & Drama (May 2029). I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area and currently based in Bloomington, Indiana. Beyond academics, I enjoy hiking, Bollywood dance, landscape painting, and giving back through initiatives like the Bal Bharti Project in Rajasthan.</p>
