A professional single-page personal website. Open `index.html` in a browser or use a local server.

## Customizing

- **About**: Replace the `[placeholder]` text in the About section and add your photo (replace the `.placeholder-image` div with an `<img>`).
- **Experience**: Edit the timeline items with your job titles, companies, dates, and descriptions.
- **Projects**: Update project cards with names, descriptions, and real links; add project images if you like.
- **Skills**: Replace the list items with your actual skills or technologies.
- **Contact**: Update the email and social links in the Contact section.

All placeholders are clearly marked in square brackets in `index.html` so you can find and replace them easily.
