# Hannah Stamler — Personal Website

A simple, professional one-page personal site. Replace all `[bracketed]` placeholders with your own content.

## Quick start

- Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or right-click → Open With → browser).
- Or run a local server, e.g. `python3 -m http.server 8000` in this folder, then visit `http://localhost:8000`.

## What to replace

- **Hero**: Tagline, short bio, and call-to-action links.
- **About**: Your photo (use an `<img>` with your file) and three paragraphs.
- **Experience**: Job titles, companies, dates, and descriptions.
- **Projects**: Project images, names, descriptions, and “View project” URLs.
- **Contact**: Intro line and your email, LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub (or other) links.

## Files

- `index.html` — Structure and content
- `styles.css` — Layout and styling
- `script.js` — Footer year and mobile menu

No build step required. Edit the files and refresh the browser.
